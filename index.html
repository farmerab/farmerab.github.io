    <p>Hey! Welcome to my website. I am Abby, a 3rd year Environmental Science 
        student at <a href="https:/www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern</a>. Outside of school, I enjoy creating things, 
        all types of things. From magazine spreads to collages to pottery, 
        I enjoy dipping my toe in it all. Here you may find a personal collection 
        of creativity, enjoy!</p>
